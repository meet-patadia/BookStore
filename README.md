#Bookstore

Overview
This project is a command-line based Bookstore Management System implemented in Java as part of the COE528 course requirements. It simulates the functionality of a bookstore where users can interact with the system based on their rolesâ€”either as a Manager or a Customer. The design of the application emphasizes object-oriented programming principles and applies basic software design patterns to ensure modularity, reusability, and scalability.

Objectives

- To implement a role-based access system using inheritance and abstraction
- To design a modular bookstore inventory management system
- To demonstrate use of object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and abstraction
- To apply relevant design patterns in the structure of the system
